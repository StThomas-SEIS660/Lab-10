== Lab 10: IT Service Management Suite

This lab will introduce you to a full IT service management suite supporting the ITIL process framework.

Here is the scenario: you are four teams within a larger organization.

Team 1: customer facing ecommerce site
Team 2: back office supply chain/inventory
Team 3: ERP system
Team 4: infrastructure (data center & end user computing)

ssh with X-windows to seis660.gps.stthomas.edu.

If you are going to use X-windows, you should log in with the following options if you are on a Mac:

    ssh -XC -c blowfish-cbc,arcfour  yourID@seis660.gps.stthomas.edu

If you are on a PC using Putty or MobaXterm, you will have a checkbox (that may have defaulted to checked) to enable X. You're on your own to figure out compression options.

Then bring up Firefox over X:

    firefox -XC -no-remote &

then log in to:
